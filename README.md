# EcoTrashAI

## Inroduction

Classifying trash types is essential for proper disposal, helping to protect the ecosystem and facilitate recycling. This project develops a trash classifier using state-of-the-art computer vision technology. The classifier can be used locally as a Gradio app or deployed on Hugging Face as a web app.

## Dataset

[GARBAGE CLASSIFICATION 3 Dataset v2](https://universe.roboflow.com/material-identification/garbage-classification-3/dataset/2): GARBAGE CLASSIFICATION 3 Dataset v2 is a Yolo (You Only Look Once) dataset with images and annotations with the form `<object-class> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>`. We use only the `<object-class>` as the target variable. Images are categorized into six classes, labeled as `BIODEGRADABLE`, `CARDBOARD`, `GLASS`, `METAL`, `PAPER`, and `PLASTIC`.
